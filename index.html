		<h1>HTML5 Code Golfing</h1>
		<p>Hello! Here are my code Golfing challenges. Here, I do with HTML what real golfers try to do in sports: do the least, but get the most done! In other words, I make fun things, but also try to make their code be as small as it possibly can! You can get more info about these on my <a href="https://github.com/pgattic/html5-golf"target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. </p>
		<p>And here are my Challenge projects so far:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="challenge/typewriter" target="_blank">Typewriter</a> (68 bytes): Type anything in the box, and you will hear the sound of a typewriter clicking.</li>
			<li><a href="challenge/cps" target="_blank">CPS counter</a> (143 bytes): Click anywhere in the page as many times as you can for 5 seconds, and your clicks per second will be shown.</li>
			<li><a href="challenge/paint" target="_blank">Paint</a> (266 bytes): Use your mouse to draw stuff on the screen! Press the F5 key to reload the page (as with any web page).</li>
			<li><a href="challenge/checkbox" target="_blank">Checkbox Doodler</a> (319 bytes): Draw with checkboxes! hold "Shift" to erase.</li>
			<li><a href="challenge/winxp" target="_blank">Windows XP</a> (352 bytes): Move your mouse around! Errors galore! click to enable sound!</li>
			<li><a href="challenge/solitairec" target="_blank">Solitaire Cards</a> (632 bytes): Ever played Windows Solitaire before?</li>
			<li><a href="challenge/dvd" target="_blank">Syched DVD Screensaver</a> (374 bytes): That DVD logo you'd watch for hours, praying it hits the corner of the screen. It uses the time to calculate the location, so that means that it is in the same location across all devices!</li>
		</ul>
